Which customers should our sales team prioritize for upselling?,"This requires interpretation, but good candidates include: (1) Basic tier customers with high utilization (90%+): SmallBiz Tools (90% utilization), Manufacturing Pro (88% utilization) - they may need more seats or features; (2) Professional customers with good engagement: TechStart Inc (90% utilization), EduTech Academy (95% utilization), Finance Advisors (91% utilization); (3) Trial customer: Startup Accelerator could be converted to paid. The specific prioritization depends on business goals (revenue expansion vs. conversion vs. feature adoption).","The sales team should prioritize the following customers for upselling:
- Acme Corp
- Global Finance Ltd
- Legal Partners LLP
